📂 Sidebar Navigation (Structure)

Your sidebar should serve as the main navigation hub. Keep it simple and intuitive:

Sections to Include in Sidebar:

Dashboard (Home) → Live sensor data cards (Temperature, Humidity, Rainfall).

Charts & Trends → Historical graphs (Daily, Weekly, Monthly).

Reports → Export data (CSV/PDF).

Alerts → Threshold warnings & history of alerts.

Recommendations (AI-powered) → Insights/suggestions (from Gemini or your own rules).

User Profile / Settings → Account details, logout, preferences.

🤖 Recommendation System (Gemini Integration)

Since you want to integrate Gemini (Google AI), you can use it for agriculture-specific advice.

How It Works:

Your system collects weather + sensor data.

Send key values (like average temp, humidity, rainfall) as prompt input to Gemini.

Gemini generates recommendations for farmers.

Examples of Recommendations:

Temperature-based: “Today’s average temp is 34°C, consider irrigating fields in the early morning to reduce crop stress.”

Rainfall-based: “High rainfall detected. Avoid applying fertilizer today to prevent nutrient leaching.”

Humidity-based: “Humidity is above 85%. There is a risk of fungal diseases. Monitor crops closely.”

Integration Plan:

Add a “Recommendations” tab in your sidebar.

Show a card or chat-like UI with generated suggestions.

Optional: Allow users to type questions (e.g., “What should I do if heavy rain continues for 3 days?”).
