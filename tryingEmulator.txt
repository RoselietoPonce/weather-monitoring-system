but hpw can I cancel that, when I dont want to use it anymore?
ChatGPT said:

Yes! You can fully stop or remove the Firebase Emulator whenever you want. There are a few levels here: stopping the emulator session vs removing downloaded files.

1. Stop a running emulator

If the emulator is currently running in your terminal:

Press Ctrl + C in the terminal where it’s running.

This will immediately stop all emulators (Functions, Firestore, etc.).

No changes are made to your real Firebase project.

2. Remove downloaded emulator files (optional)

Firebase stores emulator binaries locally (~100 MB) for offline use. To remove them:

Locate Firebase tools folder:

Usually at:

C:\Users\<YourUser>\.cache\firebase


Delete the emulators folder inside .cache\firebase.

This will free disk space.

Firebase will re-download if you run the emulator again later.

3. No charges or impact

Running or stopping emulators does not affect your Firebase project.

You are safe from charges because everything is local.

Once stopped, nothing runs in the cloud.

💡 Tip: If you only want to test sometimes, you can start the emulator only when needed and stop it immediately after testing.

If you want, I can give a quick checklist to fully test your alert system locally, so you can trigger emails, log alerts, and test everything without ever upgrading to Blaze.

Do you want me to do that?

Dev App Server is now running.

ChatGPT said:

That message is just the Firestore emulator starting up successfully. Let me break it down:

1. WebSocket server
Started WebSocket server on ws://127.0.0.1:9150


This is used internally by the emulator for real-time updates.

Your Vue app or Functions emulator will use this automatically if you point them to the emulator.

2. API endpoint
API endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:8080


This is the local Firestore URL.

Any read/write you do to localhost:8080 is local only, not touching your real Firebase project.

3. Environment variables
export FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST=127.0.0.1:8080


Some libraries (like Node.js Firebase SDK) need this environment variable to know they should connect to the emulator instead of the real Firestore.

On Windows (Command Prompt or PowerShell), set it like this:

set FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST=127.0.0.1:8080


On Linux/macOS:

export FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST=127.0.0.1:8080

4. Datastore Mode

Only relevant if your project uses Datastore Mode (classic Google Cloud Datastore).

Most Firebase projects use Native Firestore, so you can ignore this.

5. Dev App Server running
Dev App Server is now running.


Everything is ready: your Firestore emulator is live, and any Functions emulator triggers connected to it will now run locally.

✅ In short:

Your emulator is fully up and running.

Use localhost:8080 for testing Firestore.

Functions triggered by Firestore events will fire locally.

Nothing touches the real Firebase project unless you explicitly connect to it.

If you want, I can give you the exact steps to test your weather alerts locally, including simulating ESP32 data and seeing the logs instantly. Do you want me to do that?

ChatGPT said:

Ah! That explains why your function isn’t running locally. The key part of the log is:

TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'email')
at Object.<anonymous> (functions\index.js:9:44)

What this means

In your functions/index.js:

const gmailEmail = functions.config().gmail.email;
const gmailPassword = functions.config().gmail.password;


functions.config().gmail is undefined in the Emulator because you haven’t set Firebase config variables locally.

On the Blaze plan, these are usually set with:

firebase functions:config:set gmail.email="YOUR_EMAIL" gmail.password="YOUR_PASSWORD"


But in the Emulator (or on Spark), if you haven’t set them, functions.config().gmail will be undefined → your code crashes before even running any function.

How to fix for local testing
Option 1: Set fake credentials for testing

Add temporary test credentials in your Emulator environment:

firebase functions:config:set gmail.email="test@example.com" gmail.password="fakepassword"


Then restart the Emulator:

firebase emulators:start --only functions,firestore


You won’t actually send emails, but the function will run and log alerts locally.

Option 2: Add a fallback in code

Modify your function to handle undefined config:

const gmailEmail = (functions.config().gmail && functions.config().gmail.email) || "test@example.com";
const gmailPassword = (functions.config().gmail && functions.config().gmail.password) || "fakepassword";


This prevents the crash when functions.config().gmail is undefined.

Your alerts will still log locally.

✅ Important:
Once you deploy to a real Firebase project with Blaze, you should set the real Gmail credentials using firebase functions:config:set to actually send emails.

If you want, I can rewrite your backend code so it works perfectly in the Emulator without crashing, so you can test alerts immediately.

Do you want me to do that?

C:\Users\PC\Desktop\weather-monitoring-system>firebase functions:config:set gmail.email="ponce.rn952@s.msumain.edu.ph" gmail.password="Norhaina091402"
+  Functions config updated.

Please deploy your functions for the change to take effect by running firebase deploy --only functions

! DEPRECATION NOTICE: Action required to deploy after March 2026

  functions.config() API is deprecated.
  Cloud Runtime Configuration API, the Google Cloud service used to store function configuration data, will be shut down in March 2026. As a result, you must migrate away from using functions.config() to continue deploying your functions after March 2026.

  What this means for you:

  - The Firebase CLI commands for managing this configuration (functions:config:set, get, unset, clone, and export) are deprecated. These commands will no longer work after March 2026.
  - firebase deploy command will fail for functions that use the legacy functions.config() API after March 2026.

  Existing deployments will continue to work with their current configuration.

  See your migration options at: https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/config-env#migrate-to-dotenv

C:\Users\PC\Desktop\weather-monitoring-system>
ChatGPT said:

Perfect — you’ve successfully set your Gmail credentials for Firebase Functions. ✅

A few important notes about what just happened:

1. Functions config updated
+  Functions config updated.


Your functions.config().gmail.email and .password are now stored in Firebase’s environment.

The Emulator or deployed functions can now read them without crashing.

2. Deprecation notice
functions.config() API is deprecated.


Firebase is warning that functions.config() will stop working after March 2026.

For now, it works fine, but in the future you’ll need to migrate to using .env files with dotenv or the new Google Cloud Runtime Config API.

Reference: Firebase config env migration

3. Next step

After setting these configs, you need to redeploy your functions (or restart your Emulator) for the new config to take effect:

To test locally (Emulator):

firebase emulators:start --only functions,firestore


To deploy to Firebase cloud:

firebase deploy --only functions


Your functions will now correctly read the Gmail credentials and stop crashing.

If you want, I can guide you step by step to fully test your alert system locally now that the config issue is fixed, so you can see alerts trigger from Firestore without needing Blaze.

Do you want me to do that?

Error: Could not start Firestore Emulator, port taken.

C:\Users\PC\Desktop\weather-monitoring-system>
ChatGPT said:

Ah, that error means port 8080 is already in use on your machine, so the Firestore emulator cannot start.

Here’s how to fix it:

Option 1: Find what’s using port 8080 and stop it

Open Command Prompt and run:

netstat -ano | findstr :8080


You’ll see something like:

TCP    127.0.0.1:8080    0.0.0.0:0    LISTENING    1234


The last number is the PID (process ID) using the port.

Kill the process (replace 1234 with your PID):

taskkill /PID 1234 /F


Try starting the emulator again:

firebase emulators:start --only functions,firestore

Option 2: Use a different port for Firestore

Open your firebase.json file and add an emulators section if it doesn’t exist:

{
  "emulators": {
    "firestore": {
      "port": 8081
    },
    "functions": {
      "port": 5001
    }
  }
}


You can pick any free port (e.g., 8081, 9090).

Start the emulator:

firebase emulators:start --only functions,firestore


Firestore will now run on the new port.

💡 Tip: If you’re running VS Code Live Server, another local server, or Docker, they might be using port 8080. Option 2 is usually simpler.

If you want, I can give you a ready-to-use firebase.json snippet for your weather monitoring project so the emulators never clash on ports again.

Do you want me to do that?

C:\Users\PC>
ChatGPT said:

Perfect — now we know that PID 14800 is using port 8080. That’s why the Firestore emulator cannot start.

Here’s what to do:

Step 1: Kill the process using port 8080

In Command Prompt, run:

taskkill /PID 14800 /F


/F forces the process to terminate.

After running this, port 8080 should be free.

Step 2: Start the emulators again
firebase emulators:start --only functions,firestore


The Firestore emulator should now start without errors.

💡 Tip: If you don’t want to kill the process (maybe it’s something important), you can change the Firestore emulator to a different port in firebase.json instead.

Do you want me to show how to do that too?

ChatGPT said:

Ah! Now the Firestore emulator is running, but the Functions emulator failed because Firebase can’t find your functions codebase. This usually happens if firebase.json is missing or not configured correctly.

Here’s how to fix it:

Step 1: Check that your firebase.json exists

You should have firebase.json in your project root (C:\Users\PC\Desktop\weather-monitoring-system).
It should look something like this for your project:

{
  "functions": {
    "source": "functions"
  },
  "firestore": {
    "rules": "firestore.rules",
    "indexes": "firestore.indexes.json"
  },
  "emulators": {
    "functions": {
      "port": 5001
    },
    "firestore": {
      "port": 8080
    },
    "ui": {
      "enabled": true,
      "port": 4000
    }
  }
}


Notes:

"source": "functions" tells Firebase where your backend code is.

"firestore.rules" can be a blank file for now if you don’t need security rules yet.

Step 2: Make sure functions folder exists

Your functions code should be inside C:\Users\PC\Desktop\weather-monitoring-system\functions\index.js.

If this folder or file is missing, Firebase cannot start the emulator.

Step 3: Start the emulators again

Once the firebase.json is correct and the functions folder exists:

firebase emulators:start --only functions,firestore


Both emulators should now start correctly.

💡 Tip: If you don’t have a firestore.rules or firestore.indexes.json, you can just create empty files with these names in the root folder to satisfy Firebase.

I can create a ready-to-use firebase.json and empty rules/index files for your weather monitoring project so you can run the emulators without errors. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
      {
        "functions": [
          {
            "source": "functions",
            "codebase": "default",
            "ignore": [
              "node_modules",
              ".git",
              "firebase-debug.log",
              "firebase-debug.*.log",
              "*.local"
            ]
          }
        ],
        "firestore": {
          "rules": "firestore.rules"
        }
      }
ChatGPT said:

Ah, I see — your firebase.json is mostly correct, but the Functions emulator still complains because it expects a "codebase" definition under "functions" only if you’re using multi-codebase setup. If you’re just using the default single codebase, you can simplify it.

Here’s a working version for your project:

{
  "functions": {
    "source": "functions"
  },
  "firestore": {
    "rules": "firestore.rules"
  },
  "emulators": {
    "functions": {
      "port": 5001
    },
    "firestore": {
      "port": 8080
    },
    "ui": {
      "enabled": true,
      "port": 4000
    }
  }
}


✅ Notes:

"source": "functions" points to your backend code folder (functions/index.js).

"firestore.rules" file must exist in the project root (can be empty for testing).

"emulators" section ensures you can start the emulators without port conflicts.

Next steps

Save the file above as firebase.json in the root of your project.

Make sure you have an empty file firestore.rules in the root:

type nul > firestore.rules


Start the emulators:

firebase emulators:start --only functions,firestore


Both Functions and Firestore should now start correctly.

If you want, I can also provide a minimal setup for your Functions folder to make sure the Functions emulator actually runs and sends alerts in your local environment. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
how can I stop it? I dont want to use it anymore
ChatGPT said:

If you want to stop using the Firebase emulators (or cancel them entirely), here’s how to do it safely:

1️⃣ Stop the running emulators

If they’re running in a terminal, simply press Ctrl + C in the terminal window.

This stops the Functions and Firestore emulators immediately.

2️⃣ Remove emulator configuration (optional)

If you don’t want Firebase to try starting emulators at all in this project, you can remove or edit the emulators section in firebase.json:

"emulators": {
  // remove or comment out the emulators you don't want
}

3️⃣ (Optional) Delete emulator data

Firestore and Functions emulators store local data in the project folder under .firebase/.

If you want a completely clean slate, delete the .firebase folder:

rd /s /q .firebase


This deletes local emulator data, logs, and temporary files.

4️⃣ Stop Firebase CLI from attempting to run emulators

Don’t run firebase emulators:start anymore.

You can still use Firebase online (Firestore, Functions, Auth) without the emulators.

If you want, I can give you a quick guide to fully remove emulators and reset your project so it behaves like a normal Firebase project without running anything locally. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
how to stop emulator?
ChatGPT said:

To stop the Firebase emulator, you just need to stop the process running it:

If the emulator is running in a terminal/command prompt:

Click the terminal window.

Press Ctrl + C.

This will immediately stop all emulators (Functions, Firestore, etc.) running in that terminal.

If you started it in the background or want to make sure nothing is using the ports:

Check which process is using the emulator ports (default Firestore: 8080, Functions: 5001) with:

netstat -ano | findstr :8080
netstat -ano | findstr :5001


Kill the processes by PID:

taskkill /PID <PID_NUMBER> /F


After this, the emulator will no longer run.

If you want, I can give a super simple way to completely remove all emulator traces from your project so it won’t try to start again. Do you want me to?
